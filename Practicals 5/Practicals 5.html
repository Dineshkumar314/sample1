	<h3>Systems</h3>
	<p>When a bird dies an untimely death, it’s always a sad event. But what’s the difference between a Robin killed by a chestnut falling on its head, and an Albatross killed by a fishing hook? For each bird individually, it doesn’t really make a difference. But for bird conservation, it changes everything.</p>

		<article>This summer, researchers in Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary launched their fourth cruise since 2013 to document this well-known predator of sand lance in an ongoing study of the birds’ flight paths and foraging and feeding habits. Each year, scientists aboard the sanctuary research vessel Auk use satellite tags to monitor movements of ten great shearwaters, following them through the sanctuary and beyond. In addition to the satellite tagging, this summer breath, feather and blood samples were taken from the great shearwaters to determine what they had eaten in the past days, weeks and months, respectively. The team also took samples from two sooty shearwaters and one manx shearwater, the first time these species were included in the project.

	<p>A chestnut falling on a Robin’s head is an isolated incident. However, a seabird getting caught in fishing gear is part of a system. A man-made system that kills 300,000 seabirds every year – along with many other creatures. In terms of natural history, it’s an extremely recent phenomenon – and one that is entirely avoidable.</p>
